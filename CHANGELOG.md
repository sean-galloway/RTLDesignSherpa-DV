# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Type annotations on GAXI/FIFO base-class signatures.** Added full
  type annotations to the `__init__` signatures and public methods of
  the ready/valid component bases: `GAXIComponentBase`, `GAXIMonitorBase`,
  `FIFOComponentBase`, `GAXIMaster`, `GAXISlave`, `GAXIMonitor`.
  Introduced `DutHandle = Any` / `ClockSignal = Any` /
  `FieldConfigInput = Union[FieldConfig, dict, None]` type aliases in
  `gaxi_component_base.py` and re-exported them from the modules that
  consume them. Cocotb handle types are kept as `Any` because their
  concrete types vary by simulator backend. No runtime behavior change;
  IDEs and type checkers can now assist downstream BFM authors.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **AXIL4SlaveRead/Write `base_addr` offset.** Incoming AR/AW addresses are
  absolute (post-decode); the slaves now subtract `base_addr` before
  indexing the memory model. A new `base_addr` kwarg mirrors the existing
  `AXI4SlaveRead/Write` API. Without this fix, slaves at non-zero base
  addresses returned `0xDEADDEAD` or `SLVERR`.
  ([#1](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/issues/1),
  commit [`2e7e825`](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/commit/2e7e825))

- **AXIL4SlaveWrite AW/W pairing.** Replaced single-depth `pending_aw` /
  `pending_w` slots with `_aw_queue` / `_w_queue` FIFOs so pairs drain
  strictly in arrival order. Fixes silent AW/W mis-pairing under
  interleaved burst patterns from upstream burst-decomposing shims (e.g.
  `axi4_to_axil4_wr`).
  ([#2](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/issues/2),
  commit [`2e7e825`](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/commit/2e7e825))

- **AXI4/AXI5/AXIL4 master BFM response pickup race.** Each master BFM
  now routes incoming R/B packets through a monitor callback into per-ID
  deques (AXI4/AXI5: keyed on `RID`/`BID`) or a FIFO of waiter slots
  (AXIL4: keyed on issue order). `read_transaction` /
  `write_transaction` pop from their own queue/slot rather than indexing
  into the shared `_recvQ`. Fixes the silent failure where concurrent
  `cocotb.start_soon`-dispatched transactions all received the same
  response packet. Sequential callers see zero behavior change.
  ([#3](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/issues/3),
  commit [`e5ebf7b`](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/commit/e5ebf7b))

- **AXI4/AXI5/AXIL4 MasterWrite AW+W serialization.** Each master-write
  BFM now wraps `(send AW, send all W beats)` in a
  `cocotb.triggers.Lock`. Concurrent same-ID writes no longer interleave
  W beats on the wire (AXI W has no ID; slaves match by AWLEN/WLAST
  ordering, so interleaving silently delivers each transaction's data
  to the wrong destination). Sequential callers see an uncontended
  lock — zero behavior change.
  ([#4](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/issues/4),
  commit [`e5ebf7b`](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/commit/e5ebf7b))

- **AXI4/AXI5 SlaveWrite Lock primitive.** Replaced `asyncio.Lock` with
  `cocotb.triggers.Lock` in per-ID `completion_locks`. `asyncio.Lock` is
  unusable under cocotb's scheduler — `get_event_loop()` returns `None`,
  so `acquire()` raises `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no
  attribute 'create_future'` on first contention. The bug was latent in
  v0.1.0 because master-side concurrency was effectively blocked by the
  response-pickup race fixed in #3; with that fix in place, the
  slave-side path becomes reachable.

  commit [`9d6cbc9`](https://github.com/sean-galloway/RTLDesignSherpa-DV/commit/9d6cbc9))
